# 🍷🍇 K-Means Wine Variety Clustering 🍇🍷

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for wine variety classification. The goal of this project is to cluster wines based on their attributes and identify distinct varieties present in the dataset.

**📁 Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Wine dataset, which consists of various attributes such as alcohol content, acidity, and color intensity. The dataset provides a rich collection of features to perform clustering analysis.

**🔧 Installation**
To use this code, you need to have Python 3 and the following dependencies installed:

numpy 📦
pandas 📦
scikit-learn 📦
matplotlib 📦

**📊 Results**
After running the script, the program will output the following:

Cluster assignments for each wine in the dataset.
Visualization of the clusters using scatter plots.
